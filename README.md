This app is built to showcase the skillset capabilities in building a react app which consumes an API : News API using NextJS Framework in a test environment.

### Instructions for getting a view on the build

1 - Clone the repo git on your computer using the link and command `git clone https://github.com/mouzong/smarcodetest.git`

2 - connect to the directory smarcodetest-main created from the clone and install the dependencies `yarn install` or `npm install`

3 - At the root of your folder create the `.env.local` file and populate it with your "API_KEY" and "BASE_URL" got from the api `https://newsapi.ai/`

4 - launch the development server `yarn run dev` or `npm run dev`

5 - open your browser and head on to <http://localhost:3000> to view the release.
